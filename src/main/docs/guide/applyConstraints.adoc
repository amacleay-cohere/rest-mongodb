If you wish to define http://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/index.html#constraints[validation constraints]
on properties defined in a GORM domain class, you can do so using the `constraints` property:

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/domain/demo/Product.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/domain/demo/Product.groovy[tags=constraints,indent=0]
----

The above example applies two constraints:

* The `name` property is constrained so that it cannot be a blank string.
* The `price` property is constrained so that it must be greater than 0 and less than a thousand using the `range` constraint.

To verify these constraints work to our expectation you can write a test. If you used the `create-domain-class` a test
called `src/test/groovy/demo/ProductSpec.groovy` was generated for you already. Otherwise simply creating an appropriately
named test in `src/test/groovy` using your IDE or text editor will suffice.

Tests in Grails are written with http://spockframework.org[Spock Framework],
tests including having spaces in the test name.

To write unit tests with MongoDB and Spock, you can simply extend from `grails.test.mongodb.MongoSpec`.

[source,groovy]
.src/test/groovy/demo/ProductSpec.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/test/groovy/demo/ProductSpec.groovy[]
----

<1> Spock allows you to define much more readable
<2> Override the `createMongoClient` method of the `MongoSpec` base class. Use something such as https://github.com/fakemongo/fongo[Fongo]; an in-memory java implementation of MongoDB.
<3> MongoSpec is an abstract class that will initialise GORM in the setup phase of the specification being executed
<4> Use the https://testing.grails.org/latest/guide/index.html#unitTestingDomainClasses[grails.testing.gorm.DomainUnitTest] trait to unit test single domain class.

Add the fongo dependency to `build.gradle`

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tag=fongo]
----

Now to run the test you can run `./gradlew check` from a terminal window or run the test within your IDE if the IDE supports it:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew check
----
